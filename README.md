# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Cave!

> *“Code like nobody’s watching. Push like you’ve never messed up a commit.”*

Hi there! I'm **SH4d0w97** — part-time human, full-time keyboard enthusiast 👨‍💻  
I build cool things on the internet, occasionally break them, and always learn something new.

## 🧠 Who Am I?

- 🛠️ **Currently working on:** `cool side projects`, `debugging my own life`
- 📚 **Learning:** `how to center a div` (again), `TypeScript`, `AI tools`
- 🎯 **Goal:** Get 1 PR merged without 47 comments  
- 💬 **Talk to me about:** `React`, `API design`, `meme-based motivation`
- 🧃 **Fun fact:** I once wrote code at 3AM that *actually worked*
